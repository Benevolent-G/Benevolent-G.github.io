### This is my first post!

My goal for this site is not necessarily to showcase all the projects I create, but instead <br> 
to give you - the viewer - a glimpse into my thought processes.
Part of this project is the plain act of documenting my ideas - for reference, habit, sanity, etc. 
I may indeed become more methodical in the process, but I'm also learning more about deploying websites, DNS, markdown, and I'm getting some pretty sweet practice with vi. 

My project idea is simple enough: validate the "fairness" of a die. I won't bore you with the story, but the idea arose out of frustrations with the performance of a new d20 (20 sided die) in a D&D / Pathfinder session.

This project will meet certain criteria:

1. automate input
	- physical agitator to "roll the die"
	- camera to record the face of the die 
	- OCR / openCV to decide what number the face shows
	- controll the above (how? pi?)<br><br> 
 
2. run the numbers on the input (the root idea, also the easiest componenet of this problem)
	- calculate stats as they roll, narrow the confidence interval<br><br>
 
3. graphically represent the output with lovely charts
	- real time update as the program works would be pretty jazzy<br><br>
 

Though my initial longing for a stats-based project has become tainted with the likes of hardware, I'm actually quite pleased. 
I believe this excercise will be a valuable lesson in data-set creation, computer vision, software controlled hardware, and now blogging! 

I'm eager to get started, but before I do, I'm going to sit down and engineer the process I'm going to follow and set a deadline [(Parkinson's law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).

Thank you for your time in reading my first post! Stay tuned for project updates and feel free to connect with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, and github for more content.

Best,
